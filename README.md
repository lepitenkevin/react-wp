# React + TypeScript + Vite + WordPress (Headless CMS)

This project is a **Headless CMS** setup that uses **WordPress** as the backend (content management & REST API) and **React + TypeScript + Vite** as the frontend.

It fetches blog posts and content from WordPress via the REST API and displays them in a fast, modern, and responsive React application.

### ✨ Features

- ⚡ **Vite-powered React frontend** for ultra-fast builds and hot reloading
- 🔗 **Headless WordPress integration** via the REST API
- 🎨 **TailwindCSS styling** for clean and responsive UI
- 📄 Dynamic **blog listing and single post pages**
- 🖼️ Support for **featured images, titles, excerpts, and metadata**
- 🌐 **Client-side routing** with React Router
- 📝 **TypeScript typings** for safer and more maintainable code
- 🛠️ Ready for deployment on platforms like **Vercel**

This setup demonstrates how to decouple WordPress from its traditional PHP theme structure and instead use it purely as a content API, while React handles the presentation layer.
