# React + TypeScript + Vite + WordPress (Headless CMS + WooCommerce)

This project is a Headless CMS setup that uses WordPress as the backend (content management & REST API) and React + TypeScript + Vite as the frontend.

It fetches blog posts, content, and products from WordPress via the REST API and displays them in a fast, modern, and responsive React application.

### ✨ Features

⚡ Vite-powered React frontend for ultra-fast builds and hot reloading

🔗 Headless WordPress integration via the REST API

🛒 WooCommerce product listing & single product pages with live data

🎨 TailwindCSS styling for clean and responsive UI

📄 Dynamic blog listing and single post pages

🖼️ Support for featured images, titles, excerpts, and metadata

🌐 Client-side routing with React Router

📝 TypeScript typings for safer and more maintainable code

🛠️ Ready for deployment on platforms like Vercel

💳 Add to Cart functionality with localStorage persistence

This setup demonstrates how to decouple WordPress from its traditional PHP theme structure and instead use it purely as a content API, while React handles the presentation layer. Additionally, it integrates WooCommerce to create a modern e-commerce frontend with dynamic product data and interactive features.
